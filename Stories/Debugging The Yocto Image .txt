Info about the serial console and how to connect the TTL, the different ways to access it and the commands to use:

To enable the serial port: 


You enable it in the BSP layer of the target device, in my case I edited the machine configuration in the meta-raspberrypi layer that was pulled from github dunfell branch, 


  



I have modified the rpi-base.inc file, to have a baud rate of 115200 to the serial console, where ttyAMA0 is the raspberrypi’s serial console.


  





This was done by reference from bootlin material ( Yocto Slides)


  











Then rebuild your image…




To use that serial console to debug:


1. ‘Screen’ command 


* Use the command ‘ sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 ’ ( won’t work without sudo)


  



The following screenshot  shows the output of the screen command when connecting the the waveshare HDMI screen and the keyboard to the raspberry:
  



Instructions:
* Ctrl+D      => to view the terminal of the target device 
* Ctrl+a+d   => to close the screen app

2. Using CoolTerm app ( works by GUI)


To download CoolTerm:   http://freeware.the-meiers.org/


To enable the CoolTerm app: you must change the permission of the /dev/ttyUSB0 to 777 so that that app can have permissions to execute/read/write 




* By configuring the setting at the bottom of the app, the port tp tyyUSB0 and the baudrate to 115200 and then connecting
